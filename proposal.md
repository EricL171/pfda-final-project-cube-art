# Cube Art

## Repository
https://github.com/EricL171/pfda-final-project-cube-art.git

## Description
This program will create projections of 3d cubes onto a 2d screen. These cubes will form artwork by moving and rotating.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The program must be able to create cubes using a class that draws a cube that can rotate, change size, and move around the screen.
- Feature 2
	- The program will have artwork methods to create specific cube art by creating cube Objects and arranging and moving the cube Objects in a certain order that is artistic.
- Feature 3
	- Users will be able to press keys on the keyboard to interact with the program. Users can change what artwork is displayed this way.

## Challenges
- Linear Algebra, projection from 3D to 2D (orthogonal), and dot products of matrices are needed to project cubes onto 2D.
- Multi-dimensional matrices and dot product operations in python are needed to execute the projection calculations.
- Surface blit and line drawing functions from the pygame library will need to be researched further.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Create an aesthetically pleasing artwork using math and code.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Multiple cubes are projected onto a 2D surface, and can rotate to show dimensions.
- The cubes move and rotate in an aesthetically pleasing way.

## Milestones

- Week 1 (Nov 5)
  1. Learn and understand projection mapping for class `Cube()`
  2. Implement class `Cube()`. The program should display a rotating cube by the end of the week.
  2. Create function main(). main() must initialize pygame, all elements of the screen and the game loop, and have a clock.

- Week 2 (Nov 12)
  1. Implement at least 2 different methods for creating artwork with `Cube()`
  2. Add keyboard input functionality to change the artwork displayed.
  3. Review scope and goals for artwork creation.

- Week 3 (Nov 19)
  1. Finalize any additional changes and artwork methods.
  2. Clean up code
  3. Finish demonstration plan and confirm project goals are met.

- Week 4 (Deadline: December 4)
  1. Record demonstration
  2. Turn in project deliverables
